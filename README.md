## Usage ##

For search form, put in the view file:
```php
<?php echo $this->element('Filter.search_form'); ?>
```
For filter form, put something like:
```php
	<?php echo $this->element('Filter.filter_form', array(
		'fields' => array(
			'name' => array('placeholder' => __('first or last name')),
			'job_id',
			'Job.min_salary',
			'department_id'
		),
		'options' => array('legend' => __('Filter'))
	)); ?>
```
If you want to customize your filter conditions, put the `filter()` callback 
in your model. See the example bellow:
```php
	public function filter($params, $conditions) {
		if (!empty($params['Employee.name'])) {
			$conditions['OR'] = array(
				'Employee.first_name LIKE' => '%' . $params['Employee.name'] . '%',
				'Employee.last_name LIKE' => '%' . $params['Employee.name'] . '%'
			);
		}
		return $conditions;
	}
```
